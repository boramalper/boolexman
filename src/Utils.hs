module Utils where
{-| Module `Utils` consists of general purpose utils. As a thumb of rule:

  1. If you feel that you need to "import" another module of `boolexman`,
     consider moving the function you are writing under that module, or create a
     completely new module.

     (This is implies that type signatures of the functions in this module
     should be as generic as possible.)
  2. Most of the functions here exist likely due to my ignorance of the standard
     library, and libraries other people have already developed & tested. You
     are more than welcome to remove functions from this module, and ideally
     remove the module `Utils` altogether.
